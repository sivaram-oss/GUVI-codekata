# GUVI-codekata
This Repository contains my submissions for a CodeKata at Guvi(www.guvi.in)

If you are submitting code for this CodeKata, do not steal my code 
instead take it as a reference and try to learn the logic and build on it.

Unlike my other Repos, the code here is mostly written in Python 3, since I'm trying to learn it.
